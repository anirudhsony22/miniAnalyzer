## Notes
A user can filter the data based on brushing on the plot. The dataset need to be in object form and rest all features (number of cells, plots, size of cell, etc) are handled by logic in a03.js.


## Included files

* index.html - this file gives the page a simple structure
* a02.js - this file holds all the logic and implementation
* abalone.js, iris.js, penguins.js, scores.js - some example datasets that can be plotted
* d3.js - d3 library
